 This page describes where the majority of homicides are taking place in Toronto. The map highlights the areas where more are happening. When you click on a neighbourhood, you are also able to see what the rates of other crimes are in that neighbourhood. I have linked the Toronto Police website at the top, which can be a helpful resource for this map.
